eZ On Rails extension for eZ publish
===================================

An extension aiming to simplify the creation of new "modules and views" (in eZP
terminology) or rather "controllers and views" (in standard mvc terminology).

Basic principles:
. convention over configuration: create php classes in a folder to add them to
  the system, minimal fussing with ini files
. a php class can be used as 'controller'; every (public) method it exposes will
  become a 'model'
. rendering of results can be still be done from within php code or using a
  template (the 'view')

Requirements
============
o  eZ publish version: Make sure you use eZ publish version 4.0 or higher.


Installation
============
1. Standard eZ Publish extension installation method:
   - copy the files from the zip under the extension directory
   - activate the extension either via the admin interface or by editing
     site.ini.append.php + regenerating autoloads

2. Add your new php classes into extension/ezonrails/controllers

3. Assign access policies to grant execution permissions on the desired
   classes/methods to those user roles that will be accessing them:
   module: ezonrails
   function: $classname
   limitation: $methodname


Usage
=====
Take a look at extension/ezonrails/controllers/samplecontroller.php to get an idea
of what a controller class can do.

You can also group your own custom controller classes in your own extensions, such
as: extension/myextension/controllers.
In order for this to work, you simply need to add 'myextension' to the setting
[GeneralSettings]ExtensionRepositories in configuration file ezonrails.ini


To help you in listing modules and views available in a live eZ Publish installation,
you can have a look at the ggsysinfo extension, available on projects.ez.no
