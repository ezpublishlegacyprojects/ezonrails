Changes from 0.1 to 0.2 - released 2011/10/15

. the cache of modules/views/perms declarations is now disabled when TemplateSettings/DevelopmentMode is enabled

. a couple of new helper methods have been added to the class ezOnRailsController

. NEW!!! fetch functions can now be automatically declared for existing php class methods.

  1: in extension/<yourextension>/fetch_functions/<yourclass.php>, declare class yourClass

  2: all static methods in that class will be available as fetch functions:
     fetch ( 'ezonrails', 'yourClass::staticMethod', hash( ) )

     Php reflection is used to define the list of parameters available, and
     the results cached for best performances.
